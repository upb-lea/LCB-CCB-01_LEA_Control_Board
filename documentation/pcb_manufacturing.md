# Manufacturing and soldering the LCB
## Manufacturing the LCB
 * Minimum PCB thickness is 2.3 mm due to the position-pin overlapping of J501/402 and J502/J403.
 * For automated placement, the position pin holes of the connectors J501/402/J502/J403 should be milled with a depth of minimum 1.3 mm.

## MCU BGA soldering process
 * Remove all solder from MCU pad (smooth and flat surface).
 * Clean with PCB cleaner and remove all dust residues.
 * Apply a very thin layer of Flux on MCU pad.
 * Use the Rework station for the soldering the MCU chip.
