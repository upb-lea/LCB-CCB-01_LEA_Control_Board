# Improvements to next version

## Schematic
 * Remove +3.3V-Reference and replace it by +3V3_connector
 * Replace some 0402 components by 0603 components
 * Replace error comparators due to no rail-to-rail input (only 0 ... 2.1V is allowed instead of 0 ... 3.3V)

## Layout
 * Update Flipflop Footprint (Missing GND solder paste already fixed)
 * add labels for connector left/right on PCB
 * Add label for debugger "XDS100v2" on the board, so the user can directly see which debugger he as to select
 * LED D201 and D1001 red instead of green, lable "Power"
 * LED D203 blue instead of green, lable "TxD"
 * LED D204 blue instead of green, lable "RxD"
