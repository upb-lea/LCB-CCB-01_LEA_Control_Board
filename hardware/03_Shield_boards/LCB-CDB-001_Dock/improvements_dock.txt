# Improvements to next version
 * USB connector is too far from the pcb edge. It is not possible to connect a cable
 * Optional: use higher buttons
 * D3 and D6 read instead of green
 * increase distance between potentiometers
 * bring buttons to pcb edge (Problem: always touching pinheaders when pushing buttons. Note: higher buttons will not solve the problem)
 * bring switches to pcb edge (may need to increase pcb size)
 * change button switch direction from up/down to left/right
 * labels: analog inputs C2C3_N -> C3_N and C2_P (It is not clear what if C2 or C3 is the pin what is programmed)
